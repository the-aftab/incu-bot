                      Innovation can take many forms, from new
                      products to unique solutions to everyday
                      problems. Some innovations, like the printing
                      press and the lightbulb, have been around for
                      centuries, while others are more recent, like
                      energy-producing roads and rainwater-harvesting
                      flowerpots. The key to successful innovation is
                      usefulness, whether it's a new product or a
                      creative solution to a problem
